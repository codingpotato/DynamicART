All Head Blocks are in green like this one. You can connect blocks below a Head Block to form a Block Sequence. The Head Block will determine when the Block Sequence should run. Other blocks  must be put in a Block Sequence , <strong>or it will never run</strong>.  <br />
This block will run its Block Sequence as soon as <strong>the program starts running</strong>. </p>
<p> <strong>Note:</strong> you can drug out many Head Blocks, they can run at the same time without disturbing each other. </p></div><div class="block_info_box close"><dfn class="block head"><span>Blockette  <var class="var"><span>name</span></var></span></dfn><p><strong>Type:</strong> Control</p><p> This is one of the <strong>Head Blocks</strong>. (To know what a Head Block is, turn to the definition of "Startup" block) <br />
However, this is the only Head Block that won't run its Block Sequence by itself. You have to use a "Perform" block (the block below) to call this blockette by <var>name</var>. After being called, this blockette will run its Block Sequence, and the "Perform" block won't end until this Block Sequence ends. </p></div><div class="block_info_box close"><dfn class="block normal"><span>Perform <var class="var"><span>blockette</span></var></span></dfn><p><strong>Type:</strong> Control</p><p> Call the blockette named <var>blockette</var>. The called blockette will start running its Block Sequence. This "Perform" block will wait until the called blockette finished running. Then the Block Sequence containing this "Perform" block will continue to run. <p></div><div class="block_info_box close"><dfn class="block normal"><span>Wait <var class="num"><span>time</span></var> seconds</span></dfn><p><strong>Type:</strong> Control</p><p> Wait <var>time</var> seconds before running following blocks. </p></div><div class="block_info_box close"><dfn class="block end"><span>Break</span></dfn><p><strong>Type:</strong> Control</p><p> This block must be used in one of the "Loop" blocks. <br />
When this block runs, it will make the closest outer "Loop" block stop running at once. </p></div><div class="block_info_box close"><dfn class="block end"><span>Continue</span></dfn><p><strong>Type:</strong> Control</p><p> This block must be used in one of the "Loop" blocks. <br />
When it runs, this block will stop the current "loop" (a "loop" means letting the blocks in one of the "Loop" blocks run once), and ask the closest outer "Loop" block to do what it should do after this "loop" (usually starting a new "loop"). </p></div><div class="block_info_box close"><dfn class="block end"><span>Return</span></dfn><p><strong>Type:</strong> Control</p><p> Stop a Block Sequence from running. If this is a Block Sequence below a blockette, the Block Sequence containing the "Perform" block which called the blockette will continue to run. </p></div><div class="block_info_box close"><dfn class="block i1"><span>Repeat <var class="num"><span>number</span></var> times</span></dfn><p><strong>Type:</strong> Control</p><p> This "Repeat" block is one of the <strong>Loop blocks</strong>. You can plug other blocks into this block's inner socket to form a Sub-Block-Sequence. <br />
When this block is running, it will run its Sub-Block-Sequence, run and run. It will let its Sub-Block-Sequence run for <var>number</var> times. Every time is called a "loop". </p></div><div class="block_info_box close"><dfn class="block i1"><span>Loop forever</span></dfn><p><strong>Type:</strong> Control</p><p> This "Loop forever" block is one of the <strong>Loop blocks</strong>. You can plug other blocks into this block's inner socket to form a Sub-Block-Sequence. <br />
When this block is running, it will run its Sub-Block-Sequence, run and run. It will let its Sub-Block-Sequence run forever. Every time is called a "loop". <br />
This block won't stop running until you use a "Break" block to jump out of this block. </p></div><div class="block_info_box close"><dfn class="block i1"><span>Loop <var class="var"><span>variable</span></var> from <var class="num"><span>begin</span></var> to <var class="num"><span>end</span></var> step <var class="num"><span>step</span></var></span></dfn><p><strong>Type:</strong> Control</p><p> This block is one of the <strong>Loop blocks</strong>. You can plug other blocks into this block's inner socket to form a Sub-Block-Sequence. <br />
It will assign the numbers <var>begin</var>, <var>begin</var> + <var>step</var>, <var>begin</var> + 2*<var>step</var>... to <var>variable</var> one by one, but stop assigning when the number is greater than <var>end</var>. With each value of <var>variable</var>, it will run its Sub-Block-Sequence once (one "loop"). </p>
<p> The <var>begin</var>, <var>end</var>, <var>step</var> can't be changed while this block is running. </p>
<p> <strong>Warning:</strong> if <var>step</var> is zero , this block will act like a "Loop forever" block. </p></div><div class="block_info_box close"><dfn class="block i1"><span>While <var class="bool"><span>condition</span></var> do</span></dfn><p><strong>Type:</strong> Control</p><p> This "While" block is one of the <strong>Loop blocks</strong>. You can plug other blocks into this block's inner socket to form a Sub-Block-Sequence. <br />
When this block is running, it will run its Sub-Block-Sequence, run and run. Every time is called a "loop". <br />
Before every loop, it will check <var>condition</var>. If <var>condition</var> is <strong>false</strong>, it will stop running. </p></div><div class="block_info_box close"><dfn class="block i1"><span>Repeat until <var class="bool"><span>condition</span></var></span></dfn><p><strong>Type:</strong> Control</p><p> This "Repeat Until" block is one of the <strong>Loop blocks</strong>. You can plug other blocks into this block's inner socket to form a Sub-Block-Sequence. <br />
When this block is running, it will run its Sub-Block-Sequence, run and run. Every time is called a "loop". <br />
After every loop, it will check <var>condition</var>. If <var>condition</var> is <strong>true</strong>, it will stop running. </p></div><div class="block_info_box close"><dfn class="block i1"><span>If <var class="bool"><span>condition</span></var></span></dfn><p><strong>Type:</strong> Control</p><p> You can plug other blocks into this blocks's inner socket to form a Sub-Block-Sequence. <br />
When it starts running, it will check <var>condition</var>.

You can plug other blocks into both of them to form two Sub-Block-Sequence. <br />
When it starts running, this block will check <var>condition</var> first. If <var>condition</var> is <strong>true</strong>, it will let its first Sub-Block-Sequence run. If <var>condition</var> is <strong>false</strong>, it will let its second Sub-Block-Sequence run. </p></div><div class="subtitle"><a href="#">Back to Top</a><a id="interaction"></a><h2>Interaction</h2></div><div class="block_info_box close"><dfn class="block head"><span>When touch begin</span></dfn><p><strong>Type:</strong> Interaction</p><p> This is one of the <strong>Head Blocks</strong>.

<p> <strong>Note:</strong> it will start running without disturbing any Block Sequence that is currently running. </p></div><div class="block_info_box close"><dfn class="block head"><span>When touch end</span></dfn><p><strong>Type:</strong> Interaction</p><p> This is one of the <strong>Head Blocks</strong>. (To know what a Head Block is, turn to the definition of "Startup" block) <br />
This block will run its Block Sequence as soon as <strong>the user's finger leaves the screen</strong>. </p>
<p> <strong>Note:</strong> it will start running without disturbing any Block Sequence that is currently running. </p></div><div class="block_info_box close"><dfn class="block normal"><span>Wait for touch</span></dfn><p><strong>Type:</strong> Interaction</p><p> Wait until the screen is touched. </p></div><div class="block_info_box close"><dfn class="block normal"><span>Set <var class="num"><span>number</span></var> beats per minute</span></dfn><p><strong>Type:</strong> Interaction</p><p> Set the default <strong>speed</strong> to play music as <var>number</var> beats per minute. </p></div><div class="block_info_box close"><dfn class="block normal"><span>Play music <var class="str"><span>notes</span></var></span></dfn><p><strong>Type:</strong> Interaction</p><p> Play a song or a piece of music according to <var>notes</var>. </p>
<p> <var>Notes</var> is made of several notes separated by "," <br />
The base element of each note is a tune symbol which is one of "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "A", "B" meaning Do, Re, Mi, Fa, So, La, Ti. <br />
Before it, you can add several "+"s or "-"s to raise or lower the tune by octaves. <br />
After the tune symbol, you can add a "#" or a "b" as symbols of the rising or falling tune. <br />
Then you have to give the time it lasts. It should be <em>4</em> divided by the beats it lasts. You can also add a "." to the end and that will multiply the time by <em>1.5</em>. <br />
<em>E.g.</em> An eigth note of high-pitched Do should be written like "+C8". And quarter notes of "Do Re Mi" should be written like "C4, D4, E4". </p></div><div class="block_info_box close"><dfn class="block normal"><span>Play sound <var class="num"><span>frequency</span></var> HZ <var class="num"><span>time</span></var> seconds</span></dfn><p><strong>Type:</strong> Interaction</p><p> Play a sound of <var>frequency</var> Hertz for <var>time</var> seconds. </p></div><div class="block_info_box close"><dfn class="block normal"><span>Log <var class="str"><span>data</span></var></span></dfn><p><strong>Type:</strong> Interaction</p><p> Write <var>data</var> into the log book. <br />
